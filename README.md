# Linux Style Mouse

An AHK (AutoHotKey) script that allows the user to move a window by grabbing it anywhere within the window.

To grab the window anywhere other than the title bar, press and hold *alt*, and press and hold the *left mouse/touchpad button*.

Once you start moving the window, you can release the *alt* key. 

When the window is in the desired position, release the *left mouse/touchpad button*.
